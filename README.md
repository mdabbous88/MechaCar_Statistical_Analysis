# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Overview

The project herein has the following main points:
-Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.
-Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots.
-Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population.
-Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

-Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

Using the Pr(>|t|), intercept, vehicle_length and ground_clearance provide are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model.

-Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

Our null hypothesis H0 : The slope of the linear model is zero, or m = 0
Our alternative hypothesis Ha : The slope of the linear model is not zero, or m â‰  0
Assuming our significance level is 0.05%. The P-value generated from the picture above is 5.35e-11 which is much less than the signifcance level 0.05%. In this case, we can reject the null hypothesis H0, and we can say that the slope of the linear model is not 0.

-Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

Sice the R-squared is 0.7149, this means that ~72% of the variablility in the mpg is coming from the independent variables in out model. This percentage is considered high which tells that our model can predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

Summary

The total summary and the lot summary pictures show that all the lots have almost same mean and median as the total summary. However,the variance and the stnadard deviation are different betweem the lots and the total summary.It is clear that lot 3 is creating the variability in the variance of the total summary. So, lot 3 must have some change in manufactring process to eliminate the source of varibility in it.

 Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
 
 -lots 1 and 2 have their variance in the range specified (100 PSI), however lot 3 has the variance out of this range at 170.3. Therfore lots 1 and 2 meet the design standards, but lot 3 has a lot of variability in the PSI values and does not meet the manufacturing standards. Investigation to know the source of variability must be done and fixed to eliminate the variability.

 ## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

H0 : There is no statistical difference between the observed population mean and a mean of 1500 PSI.

Ha : There is a statistical difference between the observed population mean and a mean of 1500 PSI.

-Looking at the P-Value generated by the t-test, the  p-value = 0.06028 which is greater than 0.05. We do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypthesis, and therefore there is no statistical difference between the observed population mean and a mean of 1500 PSI.

-Looking at the P-Value generated by the t-test for lot 1, the  p-value = 1 which is greater than 0.05. We do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypthesis, and therefore there is no statistical difference between the lot1 mean and a mean of 1500 PSI.

-Looking at the P-Value generated by the t-test for lot 2, the  p-value = 0.6072 which is greater than 0.05. We do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypthesis, and therefore there is no statistical difference between the lot2 mean and a mean of 1500 PSI.

-Looking at the P-Value generated by the t-test for lot 3, the  p-value = 0.04168 which is less than 0.05. We do have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypthesis, and therefore there is statistical difference between the lot3 mean and a mean of 1500 PSI.


## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
Statistical study: In order to quantify how MechaCar performs against the competition, 3 metrics of importance to the client are to be studied statistically. The cost of the product, the city or highway fuel efficiency and the safety rating. 

-What metric or metrics are you going to test?
In this case study we are going to test the cost of the product, the city or highway fuel efficiency and the safety rating.

-What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?

The hypothesis can be formulated as following
H0: There is no difference between MechaCar and the competitors.

 Ha: There is difference between MechaCar and the competitors. 

-What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?

Sample t-tests between the data from MechaCar and the competitors to determine if the these is statistical difference. Correlation with the factors that addect the competition can also be used.

-What data is needed to run the statistical test?

Data that shows the sales as a function of the cost of the product, the city or highway fuel efficiency and the safety rating to show the correlation between these factors and the number of sales for both MechCars and the competitors. This data will also allow to do statistical t-tests to be conducted.
